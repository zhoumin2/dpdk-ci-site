<h1>About the DPDK Community Lab</h1>
<h2>Objective and Scope of the Project</h2>
<p>
  The DPDK Community Lab is an open, independent testing resource for the DPDK
  project. Its purpose is to perform automated testing which ensures that the
  performance and quality of DPDK is maintained.
</p>
<p>
  Hardware for the lab is provided by equipment vendors and is used to run a
  series of performance tests on new patch sets. The results of these tests are
  published on the results dashboard which is publicly accessible, and are
  also integrated into the DPDK instance of Patchwork. The results will be used
  by the project's maintainers to help determine whether new patch sets should
  be accepted into the project.
</p>
<p>The initial goal of the DPDK Community Lab is:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Identify any regression in DPDK performance. The DPDK Community
    Lab will host equipment provided by multiple Members to UNH-IOL and run
    basic performance tests on new patches/patch sets on an automated basis.
    The aim of these tests is to determine if there has been any unexpected
    drop in DPDK performance as a result of recent changes.
  </li>
</ol>
<p>In future, the following additional items may be added to the scope of the lab:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    Identify any regression in the performance of DPDK-enabled applications.
    DPDK Members will be able to submit software applications to be run in the
    DPDK Community Lab. The details of how this can be managed may be
    complex, so this capability may be added at a later stage.
  </li>
  <li>
    Demonstrate any new feature performance of DPDK. In each release, there may
    be some new performance optimizations or some new solutions. DPDK Members
    will be able to utilize the platforms in the performance test lab to show
    the new performance gains through DPDK-enabled applications.
  </li>
  <li>The DPDK Community Lab may also be used as a training or demo lab for DPDK events.</li>
</ol>

<h2>DPDK Performance Test Lab Usage Guidelines</h2>
<ul>
  <li>
    Data generated by the DPDK Performance Test Lab shall not be used for
    competitive marketing purposes between DPDK Member equipment providers.
  </li>
  <li>
    Data from the test lab may be used to demonstrate and market the
    performance improvement of new DPDK features in a DPDK Member agnostic manner.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>About the Dashboard</h1>
<p>
  There are two main components to the Dashboard; the Results Database and
  the Dashboard itself. All results are uploaded via the Results Database
  REST API. The Dashboard also uses the REST API to populate its pages. The
  REST API can only be accessed by participating members. Meta information,
  such as the series title and patch submitter, utilize the Patchwork REST API.
</p>

<h2>Possible Patch Statuses</h2>
<dl>
  {% for s in statuses %}
  <dt>
    <span class="badge badge-{{ s.class }}">{{ s.name }}</span>
  </dt>
  <dd>{{ s.tooltip }}</dd>
  {% endfor %}
</dl>

<h2>Test Cases</h2>
<ul>
  {% for testcase in testcases %}
    <li><a href="{{ testcase.description_url }}">{{ testcase.name }}</a></li>
  {% endfor %}
</ul>

<h2>Patch Details</h2>
<p>
  The Dashboard calls groups of related patches a Patch Set. This is equivalent
  to Patchwork's Series. In the Results Database, the model mostly contains
  build information and result summaries about the series. It also contains a
  link to the series itself to allow for grabbing meta information about the
  series.
</p>
<p>Times for patches and tests are displayed in UTC time.</p>
<p>
  Relative performance is measured by comparing the actual result with the
  baseline result. The baseline itself is saved on the test machine; only
  the delta results are submitted. The database has the capability of saving the
  baseline in order to calculate an absolute result, but that must be
  explicitly requested by the participating member.
</p>
<p>
  Fluctuation in these results are expected, hence a tolerance is set to
  determine if the result passes or fails.
</p>
