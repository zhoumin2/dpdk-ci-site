    This utility function determines a list of page numbers to display.
    This gives us a nice contextually relevant set of page numbers.

    For example:
    current=14, final=16 -> [1, None, 13, 14, 15, 16]

    This implementation gives one page to each side of the cursor,
    or two pages to the side when the cursor is at the edge, then
    ensures that any breaks between non-continuous page numbers never
    remove only a single page.

    For an alternative implementation which gives two pages to each side of
    the cursor, eg. as in GitHub issue list pagination, see:
